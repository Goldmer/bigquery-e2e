This directory contains code for the AppEngine examples in
chapter 12. However, it is not a complete application because
it does not include the library dependencies and the required
config files. Use the script in the chapter 12 folder:
  python setup_appengine.py <app id> <bq project> <gcs bucket>
to add the necessary components to this directory. The script
unpack dependencies and generates customized configs using
the information you pass on the command line.
